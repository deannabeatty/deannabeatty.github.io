I am a marine community ecologist by training. For my doctoral dissertation, I investigated how marine protected areas and overfishing affect coral health and function on tropical Pacific reefs. I received my Ph.D training under Professors [Mark Hay](https://ocean.gatech.edu/people/dr-mark-hay) and [Frank Stewart](http://marine-micro.biology.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Institute of Technology. Prior to my Ph.D I worked in a collaborative group at the [Center for Marine Biotechnology and Biomedicine at Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/cmbb). Under the guidance of Professors [William Fenical](https://wfenical.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/) and [Paul Jensen](https://pjensen.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/), I investigated how microbes that live on the surfaces of plants and animals in the ocean may impact the health of their hosts by producing antibiotics. I'm currently a postdoctoral scholar in the [Center for Population Biology](https://cpb.ucdavis.edu/) and the [Evolution and Ecology Department](https://eve.ucdavis.edu/) of the University of California, Davis in Professor [John Stachowicz's](https://stachlab.wordpress.com/) lab.  I am investigating what drives ecosystem structure and function in microbiomes across the coastal Eastern Pacific in North America. This is part of a collaborative group funded through NSF including computational biologists, geospatial scientists, and ecologists. Take a look at some of my current collaborators' work from our NSF project:  [Timothy Hawthorne](http://www.citizensciencegis.org/hawthorne-earns-top-research-honor-at-ucf/), [Bo Yang](https://gis-yang.github.io/), [Drew Harvell](http://www.eeb.cornell.edu/harvell/), [Lillian Aoki](https://lillianaoki.weebly.com/), [Carla Gomes](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/gomes/), [Emmett Duff](https://marinegeo.si.edu/emmett-duffy)

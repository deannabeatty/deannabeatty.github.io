I am a marine community ecologist by training. My Ocean Change and Conservation webpage is here to share my research programs, interests, and tools.  Areas of interest:  Molecular Ecology, Marine Ecology, Microbial Ecology, Ocean Change, Data Science & Informatics, Conservation Science, Geospatial Science

I am a postdoctoral scholar in the Center for Population Biology and the Evolution and Ecology Department of the University of California, Davis in Professor John Stachowicz's lab.  I am investigating what drives ecosystem structure and function in microbiomes and fishes across the coastal Eastern Pacific in North America.
